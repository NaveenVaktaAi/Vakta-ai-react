# Test OTP Workflow

## Current Status:
- ✅ Firebase request successful
- ✅ reCAPTCHA verified
- ✅ OTP generated by Firebase
- ❌ SMS not arriving

## Quick Test - Try These:

### Option 1: Check Your Phone
1. Check SMS inbox
2. Check spam folder
3. Check blocked messages
4. Wait 1-2 minutes (SMS delay possible)

### Option 2: Firebase Test Number
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Add your phone as test number
3. Use test OTP: `123456`

### Option 3: Add Temporary Bypass (For Testing)

Since you want to test the signup API, I can add a temporary bypass:

```javascript
// Just for testing - comment out later
console.log('⚠️ Bypassing OTP for testing');
setStep('info');
```

This will let you test the signup API call without waiting for SMS.

Would you like me to add this temporary bypass?

## What Should Happen Next:

Without bypass:
- Real OTP needed
- Firebase must send SMS
- SMS quota might be issue

With bypass:
- Skip OTP verification
- Go directly to profile form
- Test signup API call
- See it in Network tab

## Recommendation:

Since console shows success but no SMS, let's:
1. Add a temporary bypass for testing
2. Test the full signup flow
3. See the API call in Network tab
4. Later, fix Firebase SMS issue

Should I add the bypass?
