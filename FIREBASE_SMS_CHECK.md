# Firebase SMS Not Received - Check These:

## Console Shows Success But No SMS?

This means:
- ✅ Firebase request successful
- ✅ reCAPTCHA completed
- ✅ OTP code generated by Firebase
- ❌ SMS not arriving on phone

## Why No SMS?

### Most Common Reasons:

1. **Daily Quota Exceeded (10/day)**
   - Check Firebase Console → Usage tab
   - See if quota reached
   - Solution: Wait for next day or add billing

2. **Phone Number Not Validated**
   - Firebase might not send to unverified numbers
   - Solution: Add test phone numbers in Firebase Console

3. **Firebase SMS Service Not Fully Configured**
   - Firebase might be in test mode
   - Solution: Verify Firebase project settings

4. **SMS Delivered But Not Noticed**
   - Check spam folder
   - Check blocked numbers
   - Check phone service

## Quick Test - Use Firebase Test Numbers:

### Step 1: Add Test Phone Number
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Authentication → Sign-in method
3. Phone → Add test phone number
4. Add: `+91 7725935307`
5. Test OTP: `123456`

### Step 2: Test With Test Number
Now use your test number and OTP `123456`

## Alternative: Backend SMS (If Firebase Not Working)

If Firebase SMS is not reliable, we can use backend SMS via Twilio/other service.

Would you like me to:
1. Set up backend SMS OTP instead?
2. Or add a bypass for testing?

## For Now - Test the Signup Flow:

Since Firebase says "OTP sent successfully", you can:
1. **Enter any 6-digit code** (for testing)
2. The verification will likely fail (which is good - it means OTP is required)
3. Or we can add a temporary bypass just to test the signup API

Which do you prefer?
